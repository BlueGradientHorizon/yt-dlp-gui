Since I couldn't find a suitable GUI interface for my own use, 
I wrote it roughly myself for the convenience of using yt-dlp, 
using C# and WPF, The basic usage is no big problem
    
Because it is the first time to publish in github, there are many parts unfamiliar, 
in the future to organize and release the source code
Suggestions and questions are also welcome to reflect me, 
mainly in Chinese or simple English, while Japanese is also available
